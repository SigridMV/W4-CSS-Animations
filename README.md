# Activity Instructions

- Create a valid HTML file that contains one <div> element with a class of "box".
- The content of the div with a class of box is "WDD 330".
- Create a supporting CSS file and link it to the HTML file.
- In the CSS file, create a rule for the <body> element that will center the <div> in the the <body> horizontally and vertically.
- Style the box class to a shape of your own design with some basic background color and dimensions.
- Create a @keyframes rule named myanima with at least three animation points that transform and that changes one other property.
- In the .box CSS rule, apply an animation declaration that uses your myanima keyframe animation schema.
- Be creative and make this your own.
- Share your animation with the class by posting a link to your public code (GitHub or CodePen) in the General forum.
